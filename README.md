# Game Engine in cpp

Run the solution (.sln).
Release build setting. Compile it.
in x64 there should be the .exe to run and play the game.

There are current error with assets as I am using .obj files for 3d objects. In the git exclude file, it contained the [Oo]bj/ exclude command. This was to remove the .obj files created in the build of the program, but also removed the .obj files for the 3d objects.
